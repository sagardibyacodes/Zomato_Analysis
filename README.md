## Zomato Restaurant Clustering Unsupervised ML Project

This project utilized advanced data analytics techniques to analyze restaurants and customer feedback on Zomato, a popular online food delivery platform.**
* The dataset included restaurant names, locations, cuisines, average costs for two, ratings, and user reviews. After data cleaning and preprocessing, including removing duplicates and handling missing values, I applied k-means clustering to group similar restaurants based on location, cuisines, and average cost. The elbow method helped determine the optimal number of clusters.
* Sentiment analysis was performed on user reviews to classify them as positive, negative, or neutral, and word clouds visualized frequently used terms. The analysis grouped restaurants into five clusters, revealing positive overall customer sentiment.
* This project demonstrates the power of clustering and sentiment analysis for understanding restaurant data on Zomato, offering valuable insights to both restaurants and customers, and can be extended to analyze eating habits in other regions.

**Problem Statement**

The objective of this project is to analyze and gain insights into the restaurant industry in India using data from Zomato, a prominent restaurant aggregator and food delivery startup. The focus is on understanding customer sentiment from reviews, segmenting restaurants into different clusters, and drawing meaningful conclusions through data visualizations. Key areas of analysis include cuisine types, pricing, and customer feedback. The project aims to help customers find the best restaurants in their locality while providing Zomato with valuable insights for identifying growth opportunities and improving their services. Additionally, sentiment analysis and reviewer metadata will be utilized to identify industry critics.

## Customer Sentiment Analysis
The project aims to analyze customer sentiments expressed in reviews. By using sentiment analysis techniques, we will gauge the overall satisfaction levels of customers with the restaurants listed on Zomato. This analysis will provide actionable insights into the strengths and weaknesses of different establishments, helping potential diners make informed choices and assisting Zomato in enhancing its user experience.

## Restaurant Clustering
Another key aspect of the project is clustering Zomato's restaurant database. By applying clustering algorithms, we will group restaurants with similar characteristics, such as cuisine types, pricing, and user ratings. This segmentation will facilitate a better understanding of the restaurant landscape and provide Zomato with strategic information to address specific business challenges.

## Business Case Solutions
